# Coding Notes: TLP Portfolio

### 11/13/2021

Decided to redo my web design portfolio. I found an interesting tool to use called [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io/). You can generate our own favicon for your browser tab. I also used a [Fancy Border Radius Generator](https://9elements.github.io/fancy-border-radius/) to change the shape of my profile picture.

Resources:
* [CSS CodeLab](https://www.csscodelab.com/css-examples/): Great website for code examples in HTML, CSS, and JS.
* [Waverly](https://wavelry.vercel.app/): used to make a wave svg for hero background.

My name is Trista Lanette Pollard. My journey towards becoming a Front-End Web Developer started over 4 years ago. I became interested in computer coding after a parent approached me about sponsoring the "Hour of Code" with Code.org at our school. Once I attended a training session in New York City, I was hooked!

I started working on tutorials at FreeCodeCamp in January 2017. I have earned three certificates from FreeCodeCamp. I earned my Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree from Udacity in 2019.
